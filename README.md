The two maps I made were collecting tweets from two areas, the United States and United Kingdom.

The time collected was over a 5 minute period, but since it is late in the UK, the tweets are less compared to the US.

I chose to compare the two areas, one because we can see the difference of the news and compare the level of importance of certain news events that have happened recently between the US and UK.


compare them and briefly discuss why they represent different geospatial patterns on the map.

In the first map, we have the US, where we can see



In the second map, we have the UK, where we can see






In the first word cloud, we have the tweets of the US, shaped as the country. We can see


In the second word cloud, we have the tweets of the UK, shaped as the country. We can see

Please compare them and briefly discuss why they represent different context. (POINT 15)
