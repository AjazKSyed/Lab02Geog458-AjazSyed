The two maps I made were collecting tweets from two areas, the United States and United Kingdom.

The time collected was over a 5 minute period, but since it is late in the UK, the tweets are less compared to the US.

I chose to compare the two areas, one because we can see the difference of the news and compare the level of importance of certain news events that have happened recently between the US and UK.


In the first map, we have the US, where we can see that most of the tweets are produced and clumped together along the edges of the country. So along the east coast, south by lousians and texas, and then the west coast.
The tweet density in each area is relative to the population.

In the second map, we have the UK, where we can see that the tweets are spread relatively evenly throughout the UK. But essentially the tweets are focused in each major city in each of the areas within the UK. Along the same lines as the United States tweet density, UK has similar patterns of how the tweets are displayed. So wherever the population is the most the tweets seem to be the most, are the areas in the UK that are rural, there are less. We can also see that twitter activity in the UK is just much less compared to the US.

Overall, the two maps show how much twitter acitvity happens between the US and UK. And we could factor in that the time difference is at play, but it is only like 7-8 pm in the UK, which is not late. On top of that the geography of UK has a lot of rural areas. So the tweets are all centered around major cities.

In the first word cloud, we have the tweets of the US, shaped as the country. In this wordcloud we can see majority of tweets are about what recently happened to twitter like Elon Musk buying the company. I aimed to display how there are a variety of things people are syaing on twitter, there isn't one major word that outshines the others, and that is what I wanted to show, because the US encompasses a lot of different timee zones and some people are paying attentian to different things based on their area. Compared to a smaller country where the timezones are more constant and the activity of twitter is clearly less.

In the second word cloud, we have the tweets of the UK, shaped as the country. We can see that most of the tweets center around people talking about love or linking websites, as evident with the "co". There is not much mention about elon musk or other things.
But the UK has more foreign words, compared to US.

Essentially both countries show their own distribution of words among tweets. I wanted to show how a smaller country compared to US, has less activity and also less variation in what everyone is talking about. Also it seems less people are talking about major events from the US in the UK.
